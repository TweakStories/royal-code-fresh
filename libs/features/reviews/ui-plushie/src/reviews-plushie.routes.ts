 * @Description
 *   Defines the Angular routes for the Plushie Paradise Reviews feature. Since the reviews
 *   are typically displayed within other feature components (like ProductDetail), these
 *   routes primarily serve to provide the necessary NgRx state and effects for the feature
 *   to function correctly within its parent route's context.
